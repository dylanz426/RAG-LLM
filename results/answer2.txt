question:
Can police in the USA search my house? What court cases determine this?

context:
Georgia v. Randolph, 547 U.S. 103 (2006) Police cannot conduct a warrantless search in a home where one occupant consents and the other objects.
Riley v. California, 573 U.S. 373 (2014) Police must obtain a warrant in order to search digital information on a cell phone seized from an individual who has been arrested.
Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757 (1966) The application of the Fourth Amendment's protection against warrantless searches and the Fifth Amendment privilege against self incrimination to searches that intrude into the human body means that police may not conduct warrantless blood testing on suspects absent an emergency that justifies acting without a warrant.

answer:
In the USA, police generally cannot search your house without a warrant, except in certain circumstances such as when there is consent from the homeowner or in emergency situations. The court cases that determine the legality of police searches in the USA include:

1. Georgia v. Randolph, 547 U.S. 103 (2006): This case established that police cannot conduct a warrantless search in a home where one occupant consents and the other objects.

2. Riley v. California, 573 U.S. 373 (2014): This case ruled that police must obtain a warrant in order to search digital information on a cell phone seized from an individual who has been arrested.

3. Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757 (1966): This case addressed the application of the Fourth Amendment's protection against warrantless searches and the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination to searches that intrude into the human body, stating that police may not conduct warrantless blood testing on suspects absent an emergency that justifies acting without a warrant.

These cases highlight the importance of the Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures, and the requirement for police to obtain warrants in most situations before conducting searches.
