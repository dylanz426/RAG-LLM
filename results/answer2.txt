question:
Can police in the USA search my house? What court cases determine this?

context:
Georgia v. Randolph, 547 U.S. 103 (2006) Police cannot conduct a warrantless search in a home where one occupant consents and the other objects.
Riley v. California, 573 U.S. 373 (2014) Police must obtain a warrant in order to search digital information on a cell phone seized from an individual who has been arrested.
Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757 (1966) The application of the Fourth Amendment's protection against warrantless searches and the Fifth Amendment privilege against self incrimination to searches that intrude into the human body means that police may not conduct warrantless blood testing on suspects absent an emergency that justifies acting without a warrant.

answer:
In the USA, police generally cannot search your house without a warrant, unless certain exceptions apply. The Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures. The court cases that determine the legality of police searches in the context of your question include:

1. Georgia v. Randolph, 547 U.S. 103 (2006): This case established that police cannot conduct a warrantless search in a home where one occupant consents and the other objects. This ruling emphasizes the importance of all occupants' consent or lack thereof in determining the legality of a search.

2. Riley v. California, 573 U.S. 373 (2014): In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that police must obtain a warrant in order to search digital information on a cell phone seized from an individual who has been arrested. This decision highlights the need for specific authorization to search electronic devices.

3. Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757 (1966): This case addressed the application of the Fourth Amendment's protection against warrantless searches and the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination to searches that intrude into the human body. The ruling established that police may not conduct warrantless blood testing on suspects absent an emergency that justifies acting without a warrant.

Overall, these court cases illustrate the importance of warrants and individual rights in determining the legality of police searches in the USA.
